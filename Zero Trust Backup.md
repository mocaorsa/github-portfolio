# Lab 03: Zero Trust Policy Profile
**Name:** Mary Lou Hall
**Course:** IT520
**Date:** March 2, 2026  
**Status:** Completed  

## 🎯 Objective
Define the three fundamental ZTA components and design a simple access policy for a sensitive resource within a Critical Infrastructure (CI) context, demonstrating how security signals are used by the Policy Engine.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
* [Mermaid](https://github.com/mermaid-js/mermaid) (Policy Engine)
* Linux Terminal

## 🔍 ZT Component Definitions
1. **Policy Engine (PE):** The Policy Engine is the decision-maker. It evaluates identity, device status, context, and risk signals, then determines whether access should be allowed or denied.

2. **Policy Administration (PA):** The Policy Administrator acts on the decision made by the Policy Engine. It establishes, modifies, or terminates access sessions according to the PE’s instructions.

3. **Policy Enforcement (PEP):** The Policy Enforcement Point is the gatekeeper. It sits in front of the protected resource and allows or blocks traffic based on instructions from the Policy Administrator.

### Zero Trust Principles Referenced

1. **Verify Explicitly** – Authenticate and authorize using identity, device, location, risk, and behavior signals.  
2. **Least Privilege Access** – Limit access by role, action, and time.  
3. **Assume Breach** – Monitor continuously and contain abnormal behavior.  
4. **Micro-Segmentation** – Enforce network and resource isolation.  
5. **Continuous Monitoring & Validation** – Ongoing posture and session evaluation.

## ZTA Policy Table

| RESOURCE | SIGNAL (INPUTS) | CONDITION | ENFORCEMENT | ZERO TRUST PRINCIPLE ACCOMPLISHED |
|-----------|----------------|------------|--------------|------------------------------------|
| HR-Files-Server | User Group + Device Health + Location | “HR Admin” AND “Corp Device” AND “US-Region” | ALLOW via Identity-Aware Proxy | Verify Explicitly + Micro-Segmentation |
| HR-Files-Server | User Risk Score + MFA Strength | Risk = Low AND Phishing-Resistant MFA | ALLOW; else Step-Up Auth | Verify Explicitly |
| HR-Files-Server | Device Compliance + EDR | MDM-Enrolled AND No Critical Vulns | BLOCK if non-compliant | Continuous Monitoring |
| Certification-Records-System | Role + Action Type | Analyst = Read Only; Admin = Write/Export | RBAC + DLP | Least Privilege |
| Payroll-PII-Repository | Network Path + TLS Version | Access only via ZTNA Gateway; TLS 1.2+ | Block Direct Access | Micro-Segmentation |
| All HR Systems | Data Transfer Volume + Behavioral Baseline | Export must match normal baseline | Quarantine Session + SOC Alert | Assume Breach |
| HR-Admin-Portal | Privileged Role + JIT Approval | Time-bound access ≤4 hrs | PAM Approval + Session Recording | Least Privilege + Assume Breach |
| SCADA-Control-System | Role + Network Zone | “OT Operator” AND OT Network Segment | Allow via ZTNA Gateway | Micro-Segmentation |
| SCADA-Control-System | Privilege Level + Command Type | Only “OT Engineer” may change configs | MFA + Full Command Logging | Least Privilege |
| PLC-Controllers | Device Certificate + Mutual TLS | Authenticated engineering workstation only | Block All Others | Verify Explicitly |
| Chemical-Dosing-System | Role + Change Ticket | Parameter changes require approved ticket | Ticket Validation + Session Recording | Verify Explicitly + Assume Breach |
| Water-Quality-Monitoring-System | Action Type | Operators = Read Only; Supervisors = Adjust | Enforce RBAC | Least Privilege |
| Historian-Database | Export Volume + Supervisor Approval | >100MB requires approval | Step-Up Auth + Alert | Assume Breach |
